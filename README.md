# Download Stock Market Data from Yahoo and Analyse

Enter the names of companies in the list in `Name.py` folder. Run the `link_using.py` file. It would download data from Yahoo Share, so mention the specific names. This web scrapping project uses selenium. So, it would use browser driver (e.g. chromedriver.exe, gekodriver,..). It would save the data in a `Dataset.csv` file. 

<p > Use `analysis.py` file to analyse the graph of those stocks with matplotlib. `movingavg.py` does exactly what the name suggests. It calculates the moving average.</p>

Download the driver of the browser you use and save it in this folder.
